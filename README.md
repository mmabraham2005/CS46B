# Lab 1-
In this assignment you will write some methods and classes that compute information about the 8 surviving planets (sorry Pluto) in the solar system.
# Lab 2-
In this lab you will work with subclasses and superclasses and you will get experience with the command line. This week’s assignment is to build and play with a 4-level class hierarchy: DamagedRover, which extends MarsRover, which extends UnmannedVehicle, which extends Vehicle.
# Lab 3
In this lab you’ll start by improving the Mars Rover app from last week. Then you’ll do some experiments to help you get familiar with converting and casting. You might encounter some Exceptions along the way.
# Lab 4
In this lab you’ll use your knowledge of Java I/O and exceptions to complete a painting program that draws dots on the display.
# Lab 5
In this lab, you’ll learn about test-driven development and how to write JUnit tests. You are going to modify a TikTokManager that stores a list of TikTokers along with the number of followers and the number of likes. The initial TikTokManager is populated using a text file that contains the Top 10 Most Followed TikTokers in 2022. However, feel free to add your own favorite TikTokers to the text file as well. 
# Lab 6
During this lab, you will learn how to do the following. 
- Design and implement recursive functions
-	Understand the behavior of the debugger when tracing recursive methods
-	Set conditional breakpoints
-	Use logging statements
-	Turn off logging in a working program
